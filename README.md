# nosql-challenge
Materials for the no SQL Module 12 challenge for the BCS Data Analytics boot camp

This repo contains five files: the setup Jupyter Notebook file, the analysis Jupyter Notebook file, and the CSV file (in the Resources folder) used to pull data (the other files are this readme and a gitignore file).

All code is my own. I used BCS' Xpert Learning Assistant and Stack Overflow to check errors and confirm concepts.
